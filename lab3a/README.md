# GFXlab3a

## Build Lab3a
Navigate into the (currently empty) lab3a/build directory and run:
```bash
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```


## Start Lab3a
Navigate into the lab3a/build directory and run:
```bash
./lab3a [XML Filepath]
```
This should generate the desired .png file in the current directory.

## Claim
I did tasks: T1, T2 and parts of T3 (shading is wrong).

## Tested environments
- Almighty



## Additional and general remarks
While the phong shading is wrong, it is not completely off mark.
